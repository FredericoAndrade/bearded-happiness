This information includes personally identifying information (\"Personal Information\") as well as non-identifiable information collected through App activity.</p>\n  <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>\n  <p>We collect information from users when they create an account with our App. When you sign up for an account we ask for Personal Information, such as first and last name, email address, zip code, and age. You may edit your Personal Information through the \"Account Settings\" icon at the top right-hand side of the App.</p>\n  <p>If you take full advantage of the App and link your Facebook account, we access your public profile, friend list, email address, birthday, education history, groups, hometown, current city, photos and your friends' birthdays, work histories, education histories, groups, hometowns and current cities. For more information refer to Facebook's Permission's Reference and Facebook's Privacy Policy.

You are free to decline cookies through a setting in your browser if your browser allows, however this will significantly reduce the quality of the user experience.</p>\n  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>\n  <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve the quality of the features available through Amicus. The information we collect may be used to:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Provide the Amicus team with internal information meant to improve user experience and inform our efforts of data-driven analysis. We use log information to improve user experience and the overall quality of the App, our Site and the services that we offer to users.</li>\n    <li>Create a targeted outreach tool for you. Your Personal Information allows us to customize features of the App particular to your location and social connections.</li>\n    <li>Present our client organizations with an accurate representation of the total volunteer use of the App for their campaigns.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>We combine personal information collected through Facebook with information gathered from Catalist for the \"Match Friends\" feature in the App.</p>\n  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>\n  <p>We do not share Personal Information with organizations or individuals outside of Amicus except in the following circumstances:</p>\n  <h2>With Partnering Organizations</h2>\n  <p>When you provide information to use through the App and/or the Site, your information may be shared with the partnering organization for which the branded App was created. Where you log into a partnering organization's website, we may share your Personal Information and log information with that partnering organization. Log information is shared with our partnering organization as individuals use the App. It is possible our partnering organization will contact you in the future for matters unrelated to their campaign powered by Amicus. By logging in to an account on an Amicus-powered partnering organization, you consent to your Personal Information and certain non-identifying information being shared with that partnering organization.</p>\n  <h2>With Third Party Providers</h2>\n  <p>We may share your information with third-party organizations that provide services that power features of the App. We use Stripe, Inc. to process credit card contributions made through the App. Your credit card information is passed directly from the supporter to Stripe so Amicus never collects credit card information. Thus, if you contribute to a campaign through the App, the organization may obtain your Personal Information but will not have access to your credit card number. We share all personal user information with Catalist.</p>\n  <h2>Business Transfers</h2>\n  <p>In the event that Amicus in bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred in the transaction.</p>\n  <h2>Compliance with Legal Process</h2>\n  <p>We may disclose personal information if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Amicus, our Users or others.</p>\n  <p>Amicus is not responsible for the content of links that partnering organizations place on the App and/or our Site to third-party websites, nor are we responsible for third-party links to the App and/or our Site. If you wish to contest the third party's use of your personal information, contact the organization directly. Amicus will not be held liable for the acts or omissions of a third party. Please consult the third party's privacy policy to determine that third party's information collection and handling policies.</p>\n  <h2>Security</h2>\n  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information and to collect, store, and use your Personal Information in compliance with our Privacy Policy. Please be advised, however, that Internet transmissions of Personal Information cannot be 100 percent secure.
