We collect information from our users to help us understand how our App is being used. This information includes personally identifying information ("Personal Information") as well as non-identifiable information collected through App activity.

You may edit your Personal Information through the "Account Settings" icon at the top right-hand side of the App.

If you take full advantage of the App and link your Facebook account, we access your public profile, friend list, email address, birthday, education history, groups, hometown, current city, photos and your friends' birthdays, work histories, education histories, groups, hometowns and current cities. For more information refer to Facebook's Permission's Reference and Facebook's Privacy Policy. Please be advised that the information you share with Facebook will be governed by Facebook's privacy policy, and not Amicus' Privacy Policy.

We also collect volunteered Personal Information (such as an email address) if you contact us or sign up for information about our services through our Site. We retain the full content of emails from individuals who voluntarily contact us.

Non-Identifiable Information We Collect:

When you use the App or our Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information, such as server log data and information obtained through cookies.

Information about how you use our service such as duration of visits to the App or Site.
Telephone information such as call duration and time and date of calls. We only pull call information when used within the App.
This log data is anonymous and cannot presently be used to specifically identify you, but is helpful in our efforts to improve quality and services of the App.

When you log in to the App or use the Site, we may send a small text file known as a "cookie" to your computer. This cookie uniquely identifies your computer to us and gives us information about when you log in and how long you use the App. The cookies collect no Personal information about you and cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. You are free to decline cookies through a setting in your browser if your browser allows, however this will significantly reduce the quality of the user experience.

We use the information we collect to operate and improve the quality of the features available through Amicus. The information we collect may be used to:
Provide the Amicus team with internal information meant to improve user experience and inform our efforts of data-driven analysis. We use log information to improve user experience and the overall quality of the App, our Site and the services that we offer to users.

We combine personal information collected through Facebook with information gathered from Catalist for the "Match Friends" feature in the App.

Sharing Your Information

We do not share Personal Information with organizations or individuals outside of Amicus except in the following circumstances:

With Partnering Organizations

When you provide information to use through the App and/or the Site, your information may be shared with the partnering organization for which the branded App was created. Where you log into a partnering organization's website, we may share your Personal Information and log information with that partnering organization. Log information is shared with our partnering organization as individuals use the App. It is possible our partnering organization will contact you in the future for matters unrelated to their campaign powered by Amicus. By logging in to an account on an Amicus-powered partnering organization, you consent to your Personal Information and certain non-identifying information being shared with that partnering organization.

With Third Party Providers

We may share your information with third-party organizations that provide services that power features of the App. We use Stripe, Inc. to process credit card contributions made through the App. Your credit card information is passed directly from the supporter to Stripe so Amicus never collects credit card information. Thus, if you contribute to a campaign through the App, the organization may obtain your Personal Information but will not have access to your credit card number. We share all personal user information with Catalist.

Business Transfers

In the event that Amicus in bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred in the transaction.

Compliance with Legal Process
